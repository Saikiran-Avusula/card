# Profile-Cards

## Project Overview
The **Profile-Cards** project is a React-based web application designed to display user profiles in a visually appealing card format. This project demonstrates the use of modern React features, including functional components, hooks, and state management, to create an interactive and responsive user interface.

## Features and Functionalities

### 1. **Dynamic Profile Cards**
   - Displays a list of user profiles with details such as:
     - Name
     - Profile picture
     - Job title
     - Contact information (e.g., email, phone)
   - Each card is styled to ensure a clean and professional look.

### 2. **Search Functionality**
   - Users can search for specific profiles using a search bar.
   - The search dynamically filters the displayed profiles based on the input.

### 3. **Responsive Design**
   - The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### 4. **Add New Profiles**
   - Users can add new profiles through a form.
   - The form includes validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly.

### 5. **Edit and Delete Profiles**
   - Profiles can be edited to update user details.
   - Users can delete profiles, and the list updates dynamically.

### 6. **State Management**
   - The application uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and handle side effects.
   - Profiles are stored in a state variable, and updates are reflected in real-time.

### 7. **API Integration (Optional)**
   - The project can fetch user data from an external API (e.g., `https://randomuser.me/api/`) to populate the profile list dynamically.

### 8. **Custom Styling**
   - The project uses CSS modules or styled-components for modular and reusable styles.
   - Hover effects and animations are implemented for better user interaction.

- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the components.
- **React Hooks**: For state and lifecycle management.
- **Axios/Fetch API**: For making API calls (if applicable).
- **PropTypes**: For type-checking component props (optional).
